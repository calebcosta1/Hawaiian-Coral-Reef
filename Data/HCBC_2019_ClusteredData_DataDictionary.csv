ZoneName,"Name of sub-island zone the observation falls within. For Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, ZoneName = Island_Name (i.e. zones only exist within the Main Hawaiian Islands)."
Cluster_DepthBin_ID,"Identification of cluster that the survey level data was grouped into (if data was used in analysis). Spatial auto-correlation was reconciled by performing hierarchical clustering to group survey data into distinct clusters with a spatial resolution of 1km. The data was stratified across depths to generate metrics for up to three depth bins per cluster: shallow (0-6m), mid (>6-18m), and deep (>18m)."
Depth_ft_mn,Depth in feet for the observation. Depth ranges from 2-98 ft.
Longitude_DD_mn,Longitude of observation in decimal degrees (19-28.5 degrees). WGS84 datum assumed unless stated otherwise.
Latitude_DD_mn,Latitude of observation in decimal degrees (19-28.5 degrees). WGS84 datum assumed unless stated otherwise.
CoralBleached_Perc_mn,Mean percent of living coral cover that was partially or fully bleached (0-100%; e.g. 5% bleached cover).
SiteSuscp_mn,"Mean susceptibility score. The relative community susceptibility score was first assigned to each observation prior to clustering. All taxa were assigned a score from (1) least susceptible to (5) most susceptible to bleaching using a combination of taxa percent bleaching levels and bleaching severity in 2019, scores developed in previous analyses (see Couch et al. 2017), and unpublished data from NOAA PIFSC’s Ecosystem Sciences Division. The calculation to derive site level susceptibility is as follows: 1) for each taxon present at the site, multiply the taxon's percent cover by it's susceptibility score; 2) sum this for each taxon at the site; 3) divide this sum by the percent cover of all taxon present at a given survey."
DHW.MeanMax.YR01_mn,Mean of the maximum Degree Heating Week events experienced during the one year period before the survey date (2018-2019). Data were originally downloaded from NOAA Coral Reef Watch (see Lineage Sources).
DHW.MeanMax.YR10YR01_mn,Mean of the maximum Degree Heating Week events experienced over ten years leading up to 365 days prior to the survey date (2008-2018). Data were originally downloaded from NOAA Coral Reef Watch (see Lineage Sources).
PAR_surface_mn,Photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) calculated from 8 day measurements collected leading up to the 2019 bleaching event and following the peak (7/24/19-11/21/2019). Data were originally downloaded from NASA Ocean Color Web (see Lineage Sources).
kdPAR_mn,Calculated from weekly measurements collected leading up the 2019 bleaching event and following the peak (7/23/2019-11/19/2019). Data were originally downloaded from NOAA Coastwatch/Oceanwatch (see Lineage Sources).
TotalEffluent_mn,Total sewage effluent composed of nitrogen and phosphorus flux from onsite waste disposal systems (OSDS) (gal/km^2/d). Data were originally produced by Wedding et al. (see Lineage Sources).
WaveAction_value_mn,"Global WaveWatch III data shadowed by coastlines using Incident Wave Swath (IWS); watts per meter of wave front (W m-1), 1979-2012 climatology. The mean value over all years per coordinate was calculated. Data were originally produced by the PacIOOS Wave Watch III Global Wave Model (see Lineage Sources)."
AgGolf_runoff_mn,Proxy for nutrient runoff (fertilizers) and chemical runoff (pesticides and herbicides) produced by calculating the area of agricultural land and golf courses by watershed. Data were originally produced by J. Lecky (see Lineage Sources).
Urban_runoff_mn,"Proxy for trash, household chemicals, oil, etc. produced by calculating area of impervious surface per watershed. Data were originally produced by J. Lecky (see Lineage Sources)."
TourRec_10yrAvgPUD_mn,Direct human impact approximated by calculation of annual average number of photo users per day per location. Data were originally produced by J. Lecky (see Lineage Sources).
PctBleached_hist_mn,"Percent of live coral that was bleached observed on surveys conducted during last major bleaching event (MHI: 2015; NWHI: 2014). In the MHI, zone level means were calculated; in the NWHI, island/atoll level means were calculated due to differences in exact sampling locations between 2014/2015 and 2019. These zone (MHI) and island (NWHI) level means were then matched to the 2019 observations based upon the 2019 survey locations. 2014 data came from Couch et al. (2017) - see Lineage Sources; 2015 data came from 2015 HCBC Surveys - see Related Items."
Obs_Year,Year of bleaching surveys.
Weights_DriversAndSpatialAnalysis,Weights used for spatial and drivers of bleaching analyses. Weights are based upon transformed and scaled inverse of the standard error.
Weights_TemporalAnalysis,Weights used for temporal bleaching analysis. Weights are based upon transformed and scaled inverse of the standard error.
Island_Name,Name of Hawaiian island/atoll.
SST_Variability_AllB4_mn,Sea surface temperature (SST) variability. Calculations were made using SST data downloaded from NOAA Coral Reef Watch (see Lineage Sources).
