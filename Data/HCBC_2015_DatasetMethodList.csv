DAR_KONA_2015,Belt Transect - Colony Level Assessments,"From 9 October to 13 November 2015, coral bleaching surveys were conducted at 8 sub-transects situated along DAR permanent monitoring transects (8 - 14 m depth).  Three 10 m2 belt transects were surveyed at each site (except for site Waiakailio, where only two belt transects were surveyed).  One diver counted all coral colonies (more than 50% within the belt) and scored species and size class.  A second diver scored all colonies affected by bleaching, including condition (white bleaching (BL), pale bleaching (PL), and algal turf overgrowth of bleached tissue (TF/BL), and severity based on the percent of the colony affected (1 = 1 - 24%; 2 = 25 - 49%; 3 = 50 - 74%; and 4 = 75 - 100% of live tissue affected).  Total bleaching prevalence was calculated as the proportion of colonies with bleaching conditions scored (all types and severity), and was estimated for total coral and by individual species.  Site means were an average of belt transect replicates. ",
HIHWNMS_2015,Belt Transect - Colony Level Assessments,"Field surveys were conducted between 7-14m in depth on the fringing reefs of Lanai, Maui and Hawaii Island in November 2015. We conducted comprehensive coral health surveys to document spatial patterns of coral bleaching prevalence and severity and to compare susceptibility among coral species. The belt transect method employed is widely used across the Indo-Pacific to assess coral bleaching and disease (described within Couch et al. 2014). We surveyed 3, 10 x 1m belt transects along which all coral colonies were counted and identified to species. Each colony was inspected for: signs of bleaching and % of pigmentation lost to the nearest 5%. Bleaching prevalence for each depth at each site was calculated as follows. Partial Bleaching - # of colonies affected by bleaching (pigmentation loss up to but not including fully white)/ # of total colonies. Full Bleaching - # of colonies with 100% loss of pigmentation / # of total colonies. ",
HIMB_BAHR_2015_HB,Belt Transect - Colony Level Assessments,"Surveys were conducted in the four major inshore sectors of the Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve to provide an accurate representation and widespread coverage of the coral habitat. These areas are locally known as Backdoors (BD), Keyhole (KH), Channel (CH), and Witches Brew (WB). In each of these sectors two 15 m x 5 m transects were surveyed. All coral colonies within the transect area (75 m2) were included in surveys. All transects were placed on the reef flat at depths < 1m not exposed at lowest tides. Recorded data included coral species, colony size, and percent of colony that was live, pale, bleached, and recently dead. Redundant methodologies were used to provide accurate locations for subsequent resurveys using a handheld Garmin Geko 201 GPS unit, graphic and written documentation of positions using triangulation, and underwater photographic imagery of distinct initial and concluding coral colonies on each transect. To avoid error from observer variation, one surveyor (KS Rodgers) collected data in all sectors during both initial bleaching and recovery surveys.",
HIMB_BAHR_2015_KB,Belt Transect - Visual Estimates,"Broad scale surveys were conducted to determine the severity, extent, and spatial patterns of bleaching on the fringing, patch, and barrier reefs in K?ne?ohe Bay. Rapid assessments of coral cover by species and condition at all sites were conducted by a vessel operator and tender (KS Rodgers), navigator and data recorder (KD Bahr) and surveyor (PL Jokiel). The visual estimate technique was conducted in clear calm conditions from the surface through a look box and/or snorkeling along the reef edge and across reef flats within a 5 min observation period generally covering a swath of 25 m in length and 4 m in width. This method has been evaluated and quantitatively compared to eight other methods (i.e., quadrat, random, point intercept transect, CRAMP RAT, video transect, towed-diver, photographic transect, NOAA ground truth) and produces results comparable to techniques that require much more effort (Jokiel et al., 2015). The visual estimate technique is very rapid (5 minutes per transect) but consequently shows higher variance and requires an observer with extensive experience in quantitative assessments of coral cover and condition (Jokiel et al., 2015). Through this technique, we were able to evaluated bleaching severity and extent across the large sampling area and reduce variance by using the same experienced observer (PL Jokiel) at all sites. Moreover, the large number of sites increases confidence in the results. Coral condition was classified visually as “bleached” (pure white), “pale” (obvious pigment loss but some color), “normal” and newly “dead” skeleton using the same methodology and classification originally established by Jokiel & Coles (1974). Estimates were made in the areas of high coral cover at a depth of 1–2 m. ",
HIMB_BAROTT_2015,Photoquadrat,"Four surveys were conducted at each site for each time point along the reef slope in parallel to the reef crest at  a depth of 2 m (± 1 m). Each survey was carried out along a 40 m transect laid parallel to the reef crest. A photoquadrat (0.33 m2) was placed on the benthos and images were taken every 2 m along the transect using an underwater camera (Canon PowerShot or Olympus TG5). Images were analyzed using Coral Point Count with Excel extensions (CPCe) 3 (100 points per image). Corals were identified to species, and bleaching severity was recorded. Bleaching severity of the coral tissue under each point was assessed visually, and categorized as either white (severely bleached), pale (moderately bleached), or fully pigmented (not bleached). Bleaching prevalence was calculated as the proportion of live coral affected by severe to moderate
bleaching (i.e., cumulative proportion of white or pale out of total). See Matsuda et al. (2020) for further detail.",
HIMB_RRW_2015,Belt Transects - Video,"Percent bleaching was assessed with 5 replicate video transects 10 m long on each of the three reefs (44, 25 and the North side of HIMB). The video was taken October 23, 2014 at 2 m and October 30, 2014 at 0.5 m depth and for 2015 all transects for both depths were recorded on October 22. The video recorder was held 40 cm above the benthos and 10 still frames of approximately 0.6 m2 were extracted from each replicate video. 5 of these still frames were selected at random (random numbers generated in excel) for analysis using Coral Point Count with Excel (CPCE v4.1). 50 random points were overlayed and categorized on each still image. Each point that fell on a coral was characterized as bleached, partially bleached or dark. The mean percent of coral cover, percent severely bleached and percent partially bleached was calculated as the mean from each of the five replicate transects for each depth at each reef. ",
NOAA_MHI_2015,Towboard Surveys,"In CREP’s developed tow-diver surveys, a pair of scuba divers is towed about 1 m above the reef roughly 60 m behind a small boat at a constant speed of about 1.5 kn (Figure 2). In our modified tow methodology, both divers quantify the benthos. Each diver maneuvers his or her own tow-board. Tow-boards are connected to the small boat by a bridle and towline and outfitted with various survey equipment (described below). A towed survey is typically 50 min long and covers about 2 km of habitat. Each survey is divided into 5-min segments, with data recorded separately per segment to allow for geo-referencing of observations within the ~200 m covered during each segment. Throughout a survey, the latitude and longitude of its survey track are recorded at 5-s intervals on the small boat with a global positioning system (GPS). Following a survey, diver tracks are generated using this GPS data and a layback algorithm to account for position of the diver relative to the small boat. For each 5 minute tow segment, each diver notes live coral cover, the percentage of that cover that is noticeably pale, and the percentage of that cover that is bleached. They also record the presence/absence of condition classes of each of the five major genera/morphologies in Hawaiian waters, specifically, Pocillopora, Montipora, Porites massive, Porites branching, Pavona, and other. Each genus was also noted as the presence/absence of the conditions: healthy, pale, bleached, and recently dead.",
TNC_2015,Belt Transects - Colony Level Assessments,"Field surveys were conducted at shallow (5-7 m) and deep (12-15 m) areas at 20 sites of the fringing reefs of West Hawai’i within and south of the Habitat Blueprint Focus Area (South Kohala ad North Kona coastline) in October of 2015. We conducted comprehensive coral health surveys to document spatial patterns of coral bleaching prevalence and severity and to compare susceptibility among coral species. The belt transect method employed is widely used across the Indo-Pacific to assess coral bleaching and disease (described within Couch et al. 2014). We surveyed 3, 10 x 1m belt transects along which all coral colonies were counted and identified to species. Each colony was inspected for: signs of bleaching and % of pigmentation lost to the nearest 5%. Bleaching prevalence for each depth at each site was calculated as follows. Bleaching - # of colonies affected by bleaching (any severity level) / # of total colonies. Severe Bleaching - # of colonies with >50% loss of pigmentation / # of total colonies. ",
UH_LEVY_2015,sUAS Photogrammetry - Colony Level Assessments,"Overlapping sub-decimeter low-altitude aerial reef imagery collected during the 2015 coral bleaching event was used to construct high-resolution reef image mosaics of coral bleaching responses on four Kaneohe Bay patch reefs. Each coral colony was assigned one of three health states: pale, bleached, and fully pigmented (healthy). Proportional cover for each coral health state, as well as total coral cover, was determined per reef. See Levy et al. (2018) for detailed method description. ",
UH_MASSEY_2015,Belt Transects - Video,"Bleaching was recorded along video transects in 2.5m water depth on the nearshore flat of A'alapapa Reef, Ka'ohau, Oahu. Each 10m video transect was annotated noting both coral cover of common genera and the proportion of colonies pale or bleached. ",
UH_WALL_2015,Belt Transects - Line Point Intercept,"Bleaching was assessed at 2 reef sites in K?ne‘ohe Bay.  At each reef site, transects were run at three reef habitats: reef backreef (0-1m), reef crest (0-1m) and reef slope (2-3m).  At each habitat a 20m transect was run across the reef surface and benthic composition (coral, CCA, sand/bare/turf, other) was recorded at 1m intervals.  Where corals were observed on the transect line the species ID and bleaching state was recorded.  Bleaching state was quantified categorically (non-pale, pale, white) and determined visually. In total, 2 transects were run at each habitat at each reef for a total of 6 transects per reef.",
